# LocalWeather

LocalWeather is a web application that displays your current location, temperature, and weather condition. Once users allow LocalWeather to access their location, weather information is pulled relative to the userâ€™s latitude and longitude coordinates. 



OpenWeatherMap API ( https://openweathermap.org/current ) for Temperature and Weather Condition data.

Implemented Heroku's API (https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/) to run the application on a local server.
