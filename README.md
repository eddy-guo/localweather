# LocalWeather

LocalWeather is a web application that displays your current location, temperature, and weather condition. Once given permission to access the user's location, LocalWeather pulls weather information relative to the userâ€™s latitude and longitude coordinates.

Visit the deployed site here: https://localweather.vercel.app/

After hitting "Allow", you're all set! Never forget your umbrella ever again ðŸ˜Ž

OpenWeatherMap API ( https://openweathermap.org/current ) for Temperature and Weather Condition data.

Implemented Heroku's API (https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/) to run the application on a local server.
